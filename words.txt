As shown in Table 9.15, there are six versions of compare. The arguments vary
based on whether we are comparing two strings or a string and a character
array. In both cases, we might compare the entire string or a portion thereof.

9.5.5. Numeric Conversions
Strings often contain characters that represent numbers. For example, we represent
the numeric value 15 as a string with two characters, the character '1' followed by
the character '5'. In general, the character representation of a number differs from
its numeric value. The numeric value 15 stored in a 16-bit short has the bit pattern
0000000000001111, whereas the character string "15" represented as two Latin-1
chars has the bit pattern 0011000100110101. The first byte represents the
character '1' which has the octal value 061, and the second byte represents '5',
which in Latin-1 is octal 065.
The new standard introduced several functions that convert between numeric data
and library strings:
